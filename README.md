learning how to github

right now im getting familiar with github, i was introduced to it through steemit, which i am really excited about because it has to do with writing, blockchain, decentralization and all that jazz. its good to learn new skills and you should do that as much as possible, i dont do it nearly enough, not to mention that these are skills that are directly applicable to the future i believe will happen.
